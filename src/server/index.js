// This is a (sample) collection of books we'll be able to query
// the GraphQL server for.  A more complete example might fetch
// from an existing data source like a REST API or database.

// Type definitions define the "shape" of your ssdata and specify
// which ways the data can be fetched from the GraphQL server.

// Resolvers define the technique for fetching the types in the
// schema.  We'll retrieve books from the "books" array above.


// In the most basic sense, the ApolloServer can be started
// by passing type definitions (typeDefs) and the resolvers
// responsible for fetching the data for those types.
